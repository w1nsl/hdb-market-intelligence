# HDB Market Intelligence System

AI-powered chatbot system for Singapore's HDB resale market analysis and BTO development planning.

## Features

- **Price Predictions** - ML-based HDB resale price forecasting
- **Data Queries** - Natural language SQL queries on real HDB transaction data
- **Market Analysis** - Insights and comparisons across Singapore's 26 towns  
- **Web Interface** - Simple chat interface for easy interaction
- **API Service** - REST endpoints for integration

## High-Level Architecture

The HDB Market Intelligence System is built as a conversational AI that combines machine learning predictions with real-time data queries. Here's how it works:

### Core Components

1. **AI Chatbot Engine** (`chatbot_core.py`)
   - Uses LangGraph workflow for intelligent conversation routing
   - Analyzes user intent and extracts property information
   - Routes to appropriate handlers: prediction, data query, or clarification
   - Maintains chat history context for natural conversations

2. **ML Price Predictor** (`hdb_predictor.py`)
   - Trained scikit-learn model on historical HDB transaction data
   - Predicts resale prices based on 7 key factors: town, flat type, floor area, storey, model, lease info
   - Returns confidence scores and assumptions

3. **Database Query Engine** (`hdb_database.py`)
   - Natural language to SQL conversion for market data analysis
   - Real-time queries on HDB transaction database
   - Supports statistical analysis and trend comparisons

4. **Web Services**
   - **Flask Web App** (`service/app.py`) - Simple chat interface
   - **FastAPI Service** (`main.py`) - RESTful API with session management

                etc.

## Quick Start

1. **Setup**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Model Setup**
   ```bash
   cd development
   python hdb_predictor.py  # This will train and save the model
   ```
   
   üì¶ **Model Note**: The trained model file (1.6GB) is excluded from this repository due to GitHub's size limits. The setup command above will generate it locally using the included HDB transaction data.

3. **Ready to Use**
   The `.env` file is included with shared development credentials for easy setup!
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: These are shared development credentials with usage limits. For production use, replace with your own API keys from:
   - **OpenAI API**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - **PostgreSQL**: Your own database connection string

## Usage

### 1. Web Interface (Flask)
```bash
cd service
python app.py
# Visit http://localhost:5001
```

### 2. REST API (FastAPI)
```bash
python main.py
# API available at http://localhost:8000
# Interactive docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### 3. Console Interface (Development)
```bash
cd development  
python chatbot.py
```

### Example Conversations

**Price Predictions:**
- "What's the price of a 4-room flat in Tampines?"
- "New BTO in Jurong West, 3-room, average floor area"
- "5-room executive in Bishan, 15 years old"

**Data Analysis:**
- "Which town has the highest average prices?"
- "Compare Jurong West vs Sengkang transaction volumes"
- "Show me the most expensive transactions this year"

**General Questions:**
- "What factors affect HDB prices?"
- "Tell me about Tampines as a town"
- "How does lease remaining affect price?"

## GitHub Push Protection

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note for GitHub Users**: This repository includes API keys for easy setup. When pushing to GitHub, you may encounter GitHub's push protection that blocks commits containing secrets.

**To resolve this:**
1. **Allow the secrets** by clicking the provided GitHub URL in the error message
2. **Or remove the API keys** before pushing and use the .env.example approach instead

The included API keys are shared development credentials with usage limits, not production secrets.
